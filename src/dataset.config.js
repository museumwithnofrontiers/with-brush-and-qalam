// this package's own `manifest.projects`
// (`npm pack @museumwnf/with-brush-and-qalam-data`) — never the legacy project
// key, which this exhibition no longer reads. Shared verbatim with the
// sibling the-use-of-colours-in-art; that package's own UUIDs differ (no
// Discover Baroque Art or Discover Carpet Art here; "The Table Is Set"
